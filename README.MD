The repository contains a version of Super Mario made in Unity.

The goal of this repository is for me to learn Unity while tweaking the first video game I ever played.

## Enemies

I was curious to know how the game would feel if the enemies were a bit more smarter and actually would try to *get* you.

### Goombas

#### Death

Goombas can be killed if the player touches them from above.

#### Strategies

Goombas have different strategies to attack the player. 

By default, they will not move until the player reaches a certain distance. And when the player gets too close, Goombas will pursue the player until the enemy catches the player or the player is too far away.

To throw the player off a bit, Goombas can do jump scares if the player is really close.
